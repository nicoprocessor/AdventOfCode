 # Advent of Code Solutions

 This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code challenges.
 The purpose is to use this space as a personal archive for storing solutions, organized by programming language.

 ## Structure

 - Each programming language has its own dedicated folder (e.g., `php/`, `python/`, `javascript/`, etc.).
 - Inside each folder, you will find files with solutions for different days/events.

 ## Notes

 - For some problems, I explored alternative solutions and approaches.
 - The repository is intentionally kept somewhat disorganized as it serves mainly as a personal scratchpad.
